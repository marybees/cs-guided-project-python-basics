"""
Challenge #6:
​
Create a function that takes a string, checks if it has the same number of "x"s
and "o"s and returns either True or False.
​
- Return a boolean value (True or False).
- The string can contain any character.
- When no x and no o are in the string, return True.
​
Examples:
- XO("ooxx") ➞ True
- XO("xooxx") ➞ False
- XO("ooxXm") ➞ True (Case insensitive)
- XO("zpzpzpp") ➞ True (Returns True if no x and o)
- XO("zzoo") ➞ False

    # how do we keep track of the number of "x"s and "o"s
    # let's keep two variables, one that tracks of number of "x"s

    xs = 0

    # figure out the number of "o"s and "x"s in the input string 
    # we need to look at every character in the `txt` string 
    # we'll iterate over `txt`
    # we need to accommodate case insensitivity 
    # you could use the `string.lower` method to lowercase the input string 
    for character in txt:
