Challenge #2:
​
Write a function that takes an integer `minutes` and converts it to seconds.
​
Examples:
- convert(5) ➞ 300
- convert(3) ➞ 180
- convert(2) ➞ 120
"""
def convert(minutes: int) -> int:
    # Your code here
    # there are 60 seconds in a minute 
    # we need to take `minutes` and multiply by 60 
    # in order to perform the conversion 
    seconds = minutes * 60 
    # return the converted result 
    return seconds
​
    # return minutes * 60
